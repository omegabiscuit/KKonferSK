I don't know the exact origins of the quote, nor the exact text of it, but
someone from the old AT&T days said something like:

  "Good coders create, great coders steal."

If code theft is any meaningful metric, then I must be a great coder :)
Seriously though, this file is to pay my respects and considerable
gratitude to the original authors of large bits of this code. A casual
look at the code will reveal that much of KahLua Kore is in fact Ace3.
The many great people who have contributed to Ace3 are talented people
indeed, and I am very grateful to them for publishing their code under
a license that allows me to embed it, and rework it some, in KahLua.

I am sure that given enough years I could have done something almost as
good as Ace3, but I do not have those years, as I have bigger fish to fry,
most notably writing the rest of the KahLua mods I have planned. So I took
the advice from that AT&T engineer and stole some code. Any bugs I created
doing so are mine and mine alone, and do not reflect on the original
authors.

Thank you Ace3 team, thank you.

In case anyone is wondering why I reworked the Ace3 code into my own
shape instead of just using it, well, there is method to my madness.
In pouring over the original code, I learned a great deal. By actually
re-typing all of it in (in my own coding style) I trained my brain to
think in Lua and pick up some of the tricks of the trade. It's how I
learn. Some stuff I did on my own and ended up with something remarkably
close to the original (my I18N implementation is a good example, it is
almost identical and I wrote it before I'd ever seen AceLocale). But mostly
I wanted to learn and read and go through things slowly and have code that
I had typed in a repository that I have control over. I even fixed a few
small bugs along the way (which yes, I reported back to Ace3).

What follows is a list of people who were the original authors of the Ace3
code I used, as near as I can determine. All credit goes to them.
